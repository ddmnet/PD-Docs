# About PD's Docs

I wanted a really simple list of documents I'm currently working on in Markdown,
and I wanted a way to have them parsed, and I wanted a way to share them with somebody.

So I built PD's Docs.  It's a super-basic websitey thing that lists all the .md docs in
a directory, and links them up to get rendered.

Theres a couple config variables right up top that you can modify to customize.

This is use-as-you-like; it's not super robust and it's probably extremely fragile.  It
works for me, try it out.  Pull requests welcome.

## Credits

Of course, I just made the glue.  The heavy lifting is from two very fine projects:

 * [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/)
 * [PHP Markdown Extra](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/extra/)
